=============
#### Professor S. Raj Rajagopalan, Ph.D.

## Course Pre-requisites  
=====================
Students will better benefit from the course if they have cybersecurity background such as have
taken at least one course in the Cybersecurity program, for example Information Security and
Privacy. Some familiarity with programming languages (Python) is necessary

## Course Description
====================

This course provides an overview of the roles and responsibilities of a Cybersecurity architect in
the creation and operation of products and systems. There will be an emphasis on the
real-world aspects of making products and systems secure and new approaches to
collaboration between various stakeholders towards this goal. Particular focus will be placed on
learning from security incidents that have been reported and described in the public domain and
the importance of cybersecurity architects keeping up with the changing security landscape.
Throughout the course we will focus on keeping an open mind, creating solutions that are
appropriate to the problems being addressed, and learning through dialog with peers. In
addition, the importance of being an advocate for security in the face of cost and schedule
pressures will be explored. Case studies and best practice examples will be used extensively


## Course Objectives
---------------
By the end of the course, students will be able to

● Describe the overall structure of the product lifecycle and the role of cybersecurity in the
lifecycle

● Summarize the cybersecurity best practices that apply to each phase of the lifecycle
